        to see if you’re over 13.
        <br>
        5. Once you’ve put in your age it then asks you to select your username it generates some for you
        or you can pick your own.

        step, but it is better to add your phone number.
        <br>
        8. It then asks if you want to find friends by syncing your contacts, you can skip this step and do it
        later if you want.

        Now that your up and running, this is how you can use the app!
    </h3>
    
    <h3 class="snapchatfeatures">The most common use of Snapchat is to communicate with friends via image based messages but you can
    also communicate by just sending direct messages. Many people also use Snapchat to follow celebrities, as they are always posting pictures and stories about your lives.
    <br>
    So the main use of Snapchat like the name suggests is sending messages as images. How this is done is
    when you open up the app you automatically are at the home/camera screen. From here you can take a photo by tapping the large circle, which will change the screen, where your given the option to add text, draw, add stickers and make the image last for however long you want it to last for. 
    <br>
    To add text just tap on the T button and you will be able to start typing. To add a drawing just select the pen tool. To add stickers just select the sticky note and it will give you a bunch of different options. 
    <br>
    If you swipe to the left you are brought to the chat screen where you can choose individual friends or group chats to talk to. 
    <br>
    Now if you go to the right of the home screen you’ll be brought to the discover screen where you can view your friend’s stories. These appear along with all the Subscription stories, at the top of your screen. Below the stories section, we have the stories of people who you have subscribed too and below that are stories from companies and  other creators that you may like to watch. 
    <br>
    To view a story all you have to do is tap it and it will begin to play.
