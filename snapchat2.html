    <h3 id="snapchattext3">There are many ways that snapchat can be used for educational purposes. Here are some examples:
    Q&A’s are very helpful with snapchat as it is not as formal as using email. It sparks a better connection between the teacher and student, therefore the student may be able to take in the information given to them easier.
    <br>
    Another useful tool that snapchat has is the ability to create group chats for homework, useful links, notes, etc. What’s even better is the group call tool, this may not work as well with a large group but with a smaller group of students this could be very useful. It gives that person to person feel when you could be all be in completely different locations.
    Snapchat has this tool where stories are taken down after 24 hours which would be useful for students who have any questions or need help with something. It is up long enough for the teacher to read but also it is automatically taken down after the 24 hour period giving anonymity and privacy to the student.
    <br>
    Stories are also useful for teachers to upload homework, reminders, notes and even questions for their students. Stories could be used for students to take part in quizzes or even links to useful videos or articles etc.
    <br>
    Either way the possibilities are near unlimited when it comes to snapchat, it is a very fun way to educate and stay connected with your students.

    <span>Age Limits</span>
    <br>
    On the Appstore Snapchat is recommended to those 12+ years of age. The age warnings
    include; “infrequent/mild profanity or crude humour, infrequent/mild sexual content and
    nudity, infrequent/mild mature/suggestive themes and infrequent/mild alcohol,tobacco or
    drug use or references.”
    <br>
    <span>Misuse</span>
    <br>
    Snapchat is mainly used for texting and sending photos to friends. It can be misused by
    people by using it for selling explicit images or drugs, or bullying and harassment. Snapchat
    tries to prevent this but it still happens everyday. It's not endorsed by Snapchat so that type
    of content has to be seeked out or promoted through others. Due to this Snapchat has said
    that they cant guarantee the app will be a safe space so they ask you to follow the terms of
    service. If you violate the terms you can be banned from using the app.
    <br>
    <span>Abuse and Trolling</span>
    <br>
    In an interview with ‘Teen Vogue’ they found that “Out of 10 teenagers who talked to Teen Vogue, only one claimed they had not been on the receiving end of harassment on Snapchat.” On snapchat there are many ways people can be bullied or harassed some of which include; screenshotting and posting private photos of someone on your story or sharing them with others privately and by using anonymous messengers available on the
    platform to bully people.

    <h3 class="snapchatshots2">I hope this really helps you with learning how to use Snapchat and then maybe gives you some ideas on how to use it for teaching and leaning. Snapchat, like all social media applications do have there downfalls, which need to be considered before use.
